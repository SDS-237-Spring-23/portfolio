# Community Labor Log
 
## About  
This course has many components to navigate.  In order to track all of the assignments, you may choose to use the [Labor Log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ahKGbRlpoAbr-zeyR9edX0S4yrg9TnYlVZBFD8gq4JM/copy#gid=2140549662) on Google Docs by copying it to your own Google Drive.  Instructions for how to use it are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YQXvS03YlkrWim4W4XSsF5lHo623tL7iVkN4eMGieUc/edit?usp=sharing).  To report your Community Labor, you need to use the Community Labor Log here on GitHub.

## Instructions  
Your community labor will be kept track of through the Community Labor Log in `community-labor-log.Rmd`.  To record a piece of labor:

1. Open `community-labor-log.Rmd`.
2. Find the corresponding labor in the Community Labor Table.  
3. Update the Date to reflect when you completed the labor.  For example, to record your first Peer Review Workshop, find the line `add_row(Labor = "Peer Review Workshop 1", Date = NA)`, and change `Date = NA` to `Date = "2/21"`. Make sure the date is in quotes.  
4. If you're recording Slack Engagement or Class Notes, you **must** add a link to your post.  To add a link, hover over your message on Slack, click “More Actions”, then click on “Copy link”.  Find the `add_row` for the engagement, and paste your link between the `()` of `[Slack Engagement #]()`.  It should say `[Slack Engagement #](Your Link Here)`.  
5. Knit the document to see your Community Labor Log complete.  
6. (optional) update your table using the kableExtra package to look how you'd like!
