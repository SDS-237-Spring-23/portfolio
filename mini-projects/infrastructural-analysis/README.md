# Cultural analysis of a data infrastructure

For this assignment, you will *either* 1) select a standard classification system into which values in a certain dataset get organized, or 2) select a standard index/formula used to calculate certain types of values. You will then interpret the infrastructure through a socio-cultural lens. You will briefly research the history of changes to the infrastructure and closely examine its structure, considering what forms of representation it affords and what it eclipses.

## Selecting a data infrastructure

There is a lot of flexibility in selecting a data infrastructure to analyze. However, one notable constraint is that, for whatever infrastructure you select, you must be able to identify at least one dataset that contains values that rely on that infrastructure.

Examples of classification systems you may select include:

* Standard Industrial Classification System (SIC) or the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS)
* Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education
* BISAC Subject Headings List
* Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)

Examples of standard indices/formulas you may select include:

* Body Mass Index (BMI)
* Official Poverty Measure (OPM)
* Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

If you select a system not on this list, please DM me on Slack for approval before proceeding with the analysis. 

## Analyzing the data infrastructure

First, you should navigate through the documentation for the infrastructure, reflecting on how concepts are organized and sub-organized, along with notable absences. What cultural stories does this infrastructure convey? How does the infrastructure reflect the socio-cultural conditions that when into its creation?

Then you should identify five reputable sources that describe something about the history of this data infrastructure. Create an annotated bibliography in `infrastructural-analysis-annotated-bib.Rmd` that provides a full citation for the source and includes 2-3 sentences detailing what you learn from that source. 

Finally, you should review the documentation for at least one tabular dataset that relies on this infrastructure to report certain values. You can find such datasets on sites like data.gov or state/municipal open data portals. 

## Write-up

Following your analysis, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo in `infrastructural-analysis-writeup.Rmd` presenting an argument about **the social implications of how this infrastructure organizes information and mediates the values recorded in the dataset you identified**. You should engage thick description as you detail the structure and organization of the infrastructure and interpret its symbolic meaning. 

I want to emphasize that this is not a literature review, and you should not approach this assignment simply by regurgitating what you learn in the sources you find. Instead, you should focus on analyzing the ways in which the infrastructure both enables and delimits knowledge production by closely studying how its component parts are organized and how they impact your dataset. The sources you find should serve to provide context for the points that you make. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.

## Criteria for completion

* Student composes an annotated bibliography with at least 5 relevant entries in `infrastructural-analysis-annotated-bib.Rmd`. Each entry includes a full citation and 2-3 summary sentences. 
* Student writes a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting the data infrastructure in `infrastructural-analysis-writeup.Rmd`. All sources are properly cited in the write-up.
